# UFOs

## Overview 
Client Dana requested a webpage with a dynamic table included to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings. One caviat for the site, users must be able to apply multiple filters at the same time. These filters include: date, city, state, country, and shape. All data for Dana's website is stored in a JavaScript array, allowing UFO enthusiasts across the globe to view the data in a simple way.

## Results
Now that Dana has a fully functioning site, UFO enthusiasts and all other users have the ability to filter the data to their preferred specifications by entering their preference in the search filters. After users have chosen their filters, Dana's new site automatically applies the requested filters and shows all relevant data matching user specifications. For example, if a user wanted to search for all UFO sightings in San Diego, CA where the UFO was reported as a 'circle' shape, they would enter their information and be rewareded with three UFO sightings, ranging from 3-20 minutes long; however, only 1 of the 3 results would match the total filter specifications. The greater the filter specifications, the less likely a perfect match will be presented, which is why Dana's website will provide all relevant results, rather than only exact matches. For visual reference, see below:

## Summary
While Dana's site is fully functioning and aesthetically pleasing, it's not perfect, yet. One clear drawback that would be addressed in further development is the lack of recent information. The entirety of data presented on the site is now 12 years old, while this data is still valuable and meets filter specifications, it's not as recent as most users would expect. A full decade later, users expectations are higher than ever and data from 2010 won't excite them the way data from 2020 would, which is why additional research and updated data implementation would take priority in further development.

Two recommendations for furhter development which simply improve user experience are open user forums and filter bar dropdown menus. Open user forums create a sense of community on the site, where UFO enthusiasts, skeptics, believers or non-believers can discuss and debate with eachother in a comfortable environment. As the sense of community grows, the time spent on the site grows, which benefits Dana tremendously. Not only will the discussion forums allow users to voice their opinions, they may change others opinions. For instance, a non-believer may log on to disprove the theories; and, after spending enough time reading through the forums, links & pictures posted, their mind can begin to open and suddenly an impossible idea is now possible.  

Filter bar dropdown menus allow users to input their filter preferences quickly, and eliminate the potential for spelling errors which could limit or alter results. A simple change like this can assure users are seeing the results they're looking for.
